        <div class="article-body">
            <p>China's rapid demographic transition has created unprecedented challenges in elder care. With over 250 million people aged 60 and above, the country faces a complex web of social, economic, and healthcare challenges that require innovative solutions.</p>

            <h2>The Scale of the Challenge</h2>
            <p>The numbers tell a compelling story: China's elderly population is growing faster than any other age group, while the working-age population is shrinking. This demographic shift, combined with the legacy of the one-child policy, has created a "4-2-1" family structure where one child must support two parents and four grandparents.</p>

            <h2>Policy Implications</h2>
            <p>Current policies and systems are struggling to keep pace with these demographic changes. While the government has implemented various initiatives to support elderly care, gaps remain in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Healthcare coverage and accessibility</li>
                <li>Long-term care insurance</li>
                <li>Community-based support services</li>
                <li>Professional caregiver training</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Innovative Solutions</h2>
            <p>Several promising approaches are emerging to address these challenges:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smart home technology for elderly monitoring</li>
                <li>Community-based care models</li>
                <li>Intergenerational living arrangements</li>
                <li>Digital health platforms</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Role of Technology</h2>
            <p>Technology is playing an increasingly important role in elder care. From health monitoring devices to social connection platforms, digital solutions are helping bridge the gap between traditional family care and modern healthcare needs.</p>

            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>Addressing China's elder care crisis requires a multi-faceted approach that combines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Policy reform and innovation</li>
                <li>Technology integration</li>
                <li>Community engagement</li>
                <li>Family support systems</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="article-footer">
                <p>By addressing these challenges head-on, we can create a more sustainable and compassionate system of elder care that serves the needs of China's aging population.</p>
