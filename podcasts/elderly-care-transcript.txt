Chinese youth e-cigarette recovery -- the power of the family

[Introduction]
Welcome to Health Voices. I'm Emily, and today, my partner Rocho and I will talk about a serious yet often overlooked issue—teen vaping in China.

A 2022 survey found that over 10% of teenagers aged 15 to 18 in China have already tried e-cigarettes, with many becoming dependent. The nicotine in these devices isn't just addictive—it can actually interfere with brain development in ways that are irreversible.

[Case Study: Xiao Jie's Story]
Xiao Jie was 15 when he took his first puff of an e-cigarette. At first, it was occasional. Then, it became a habit. Eventually, it was something he couldn't go a day without.

When his parents discovered his e-cigarette, they chose understanding over anger. His mom said: "When I found it, my heart just sank. I was angry, but more than that, I was scared. I confronted him, but he just stayed silent. That's when I realized—I couldn't just scold him. I needed to understand why he started in the first place."

[Family Support]
Instead of punishing him, his parents took a different approach. They sat him down and had a real, honest conversation. They took him to a doctor to hear firsthand how vaping affects the brain and lungs. They teamed up with his school to create a support system.

Xiao Jie said: "At first, it was brutal. I'd see my friends vaping, and I'd get this crazy urge to join them. But then, I'd remember my parents—they were fighting for me, so how could I just give up? Their support kept me going."

[Expert Insights]
Dr. Yang Wei, Adolescent Health Specialist:
"Early intervention and education are crucial in preventing e-cigarette use among youth."

Mr. Li Hong, High School Principal:
"We need to work with parents and community organizations to create a comprehensive prevention strategy."

[Conclusion]
After a year of ups and downs, Xiao Jie finally kicked the habit. Today, he's using his experience to help others, speaking at his school about the dangers of vaping. His message to other teens: "I just want other teens to know—vaping isn't cool. It's messing with your body in ways you don't even realize. But if you're struggling, don't be afraid to ask for help. Your family, your teachers—they want to support you. And no matter how hard it seems, you can turn things around."
