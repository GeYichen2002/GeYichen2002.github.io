\fs24 \cf0 Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Hey everyone, welcome back to \'93Health Voices\'94. I\'92m your host, Emily, and today, my patner Rocho and I will talk about a serious yet often overlooked issue\'97teen vaping in China.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
Hi, Emily! Thanks for having me. This is such an important topic, and I\'92m excited to dive into it with you.E-cigarettes have become so popular among young people, and they\'92re often marketed as a \'93safer\'94 alternative to smoking. But the reality is, the risks are very real.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Exactly, Rocho. The impact on teenagers\'97both physically and mentally\'97can be devastating. Today, we\'92re sharing a personal story that sheds light on how difficult it can be to break free from e-cigarettes and the incredible role family support plays in the process. This is the story of Xiao Jie, a teenager from Shanghai, who found himself caught in the grip of vaping but managed to turn his life around.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
Wow, that sounds like such a powerful story. Can you give us some context about how big this issue is in China?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
For sure. Did you see that one 2022 survey found that over 10% of teenagers aged 15 to 18 in China, they already tried e-cigarettes, with many becoming dependent. That's a pretty significant number. The nicotine in these devices isn\'92t just addictive\'97it can actually interfere with brain development in ways that are irreversible.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
That\'92s terrifying. And I imagine most teens don\'92t even realize what they\'92re getting into when they start.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Exactly. For many, it starts as just a casual thing, maybe something their friends are doing. But before they know it, it becomes a daily habit. Some even go to great lengths to hide it from their families and schools. That brings us to Xiao Jie\'92s story.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
What happened with Xiao Jie?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Xiao Jie was 15 when he took his first puff of an e-cigarette. At the time, it seemed harmless\'97just something his friends were experimenting with. Wanting to fit in, he gave it a try. At first, it was occasional. Then, it became a habit. Eventually, it was something he couldn\'92t go a day without.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
That\'92s so common\'97peer pressure can be such a powerful influence. Did his parents find out?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Yes, they did. Xiao Jie\'92s mom described the moment she found the e-cigarette in his backpack. She said, 
\f2\i \'93When I found it, my heart just sank. I was angry, but more than that, I was scared. I confronted him, but he just stayed silent. That\'92s when I realized\'97I couldn\'92t just scold him. I needed to understand why he started in the first place.\'94
\f1\i0 \

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
That\'92s such a raw and honest reaction. It\'92s not easy for parents to stay calm in a situation like that, but it sounds like she really thought about how to approach it.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Yeah. Instead of punishing him, his parents took a different approach. They sat him down and had a real, honest conversation. His mom continued, 
\f2\i \'93We told him we weren\'92t there to judge him. We just wanted him to be healthy. We even took him to a doctor, so he could hear firsthand how vaping affects the brain and lungs.\'94
\f1\i0 \

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
That\'92s such a thoughtful way to handle it. Bringing in a medical professional to explain the risks\'97that\'92s a powerful way to make the dangers real for a teenager.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Absolutely. But they didn\'92t stop there. They teamed up with his school to create a support system. His teacher assigned a counselor to help him quit gradually, and his dad\'97determined to keep him on track\'97started exercising with him every day. Slowly, things started to change.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
That\'92s incredible. It\'92s amazing how much of a difference a strong support system can make.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Yes. Xiao Jie said, 
\f2\i \'93At first, it was brutal. I\'92d see my friends vaping, and I\'92d get this crazy urge to join them. But then, I\'92d remember my parents\'97they were fighting for me, so how could I just give up? Their support kept me going.\'94
\f1\i0 \

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
What an inspiring story. It really shows how powerful family support can be.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
It really does. When parents approach these situations with understanding instead of anger, it makes all the difference. Schools and communities also play a huge role in helping teens break free from addiction.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
That\'92s so moving. It really shows how much family support can mean to someone trying to break free from an addiction.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
yeah. After a year of ups and downs, Xiao Jie finally kicked the habit. And today, He\'92s using his experience to help others, speaking at his school about the dangers of vaping.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
That\'92s such a full-circle moment. What did Xiao Jie say about his experience now?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
He shared this powerful message: 
\f2\i \'93I just want other teens to know\'97vaping isn\'92t cool. It\'92s messing with your body in ways you don\'92t even realize. But if you\'92re struggling, don\'92t be afraid to ask for help. Your family, your teachers\'97they want to support you. And no matter how hard it seems, you can turn things around.\'94
\f1\i0 \

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0 \
What an inspiring message. It\'92s a reminder that no one has to face these challenges alone.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Absolutely. Xiao Jie\'92s story is proof that with the right support, anyone can overcome addiction and build a healthier future.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
Here are some key steps:\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  Me too, Emily! This is such an important issue. Teen drinking is becoming more and more serious, and it\'92s something we all need to pay attention to.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  Yeah, it's a subject that I think can really hit home for a lot of our listeners out there. And today we also have this really moving audio diary from a young man named Li Yang, who bravely shared his personal journeys. Like he describes himself, you know, at the beginning of his diary as this really happy, successful student involved in tons of activities. But then everything just kind of changed after his first drink at a party. Rocho, can you picture the scene? A group of teenagers, thinking it\'92s \'93cool\'94 to drink, they\'92re drinking way too much without realizing the consequences. That first experience made Li Yang realize that alcohol helped him escape\'97at least for a moment\'97from the stress of school and other pressures in his life.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  Oh yeah. Teens have weaker self-control, so it\'92s so easy to overdo it. you know, alcohol can feel like a solution at first. It numbs the pain. It gives this like temporary sense of confidence or relief, but you know, it never really addresses the root issues. And over time, it just creates a whole new set of problems.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  Right. Before long, he started sneaking out with friends to bars or drinking at home when his parents weren\'92t around. His grades started dropping, and the once-outgoing Li Yang became more withdrawn.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  That\'92s heartbreaking. A sudden drop in grades, a change in personality\'97his parents must have been really worried. How did they find out what was going on?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  They had their suspicions. But the truth really hit them one night when he came home completely drunk. At that moment, there was no hiding it anymore. His parents were absolutely shocked and heartbroken. They never imagined that their once well-behaved son would fall into alcohol abuse.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  I think any parent would be devastated. You know, how a family responds to that crisis is crucial. So what did they do?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  They didn\'92t yell or punish him immediately. Instead, they sat down with him for a serious talk. They told him they understood that he was struggling, but drinking wasn\'92t the way to deal with it. And that\'92s when Li Yang finally opened up. He talked about the intense academic pressure he was under, the conflicts he had with friends\'97things he hadn\'92t shared before.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  So his parents heard him, they understood, but they didn't just stop there, right? Like what steps did they actually take to actively support Liyang's recovery?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  Absolutely. They made some big changes in their daily lives to support him. They cut down on unnecessary social gatherings and made sure to spend more time with him. Every evening, they would go for walks together, just talking and reconnecting as a family. They also took him to see a psychologist, where he could work through his emotions and learn healthier ways to cope with stress.\
Li Yang mentions those walks in his diary and he admits that at first he was really resistant, you know, like he just wanted to be left alone in his room. But over time, those walks became something he actually looked forward to. Like that quiet connection with his parents just started to chip away at all that isolation he was doing.\
And Li Yang's parents understood that he might need some extra help, you know, so they found him a therapist who specializes in adolescent addiction. And while he was hesitant at first, he eventually agreed to give it a shot.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  That was a really smart move on their part. And this really highlights the importance of professional intervention, you know. Because addiction is complex, and a lot of times there are underlying mental health issues that need to be addressed. And a trained therapist can help, you know, unpack all that and give teens the coping mechanisms they need to handle those challenges. It must have taken so much effort and patience. But was Xiaofeng willing to cooperate? I mean, quitting alcohol isn\'92t easy\'97did he ever want to give up?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  There was one time when he almost relapsed\'97he tried sneaking out for a drink, but his parents caught him. Instead of scolding him, they sat down with him and reminded him of all the happy times they had together before alcohol took over his life.\
Li Yang talks about how in that moment, hearing his parent's words and seeing the genuine love and concern in their eyes, something just shifted inside of him. He realized that his drinking wasn't just hurting himself, you know, is hurting the people he loved most in the world.\
It was like a major turning point. And from that point on, Li Yang's recovery just gained so much momentum. Like he really reengaged with his studies, reconnected with some old friends who didn't drink, and he even joined this volunteer group to help younger kids avoid the same path that he went down.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  That is such a powerful story. It really shows that family plays a crucial role in a teenager\'92s life, especially when they\'92re struggling. His parents\'92 patience and love, combined with Li Yang\'92s own determination, created a happy ending. I really hope Li Yang\'92s story serves as a reminder that alcohol doesn\'92t solve problems\'97it only creates more. And for families out there, never underestimate the power of your love and support.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  So as we wrap up this deep dive, I'm left with a question for all of you listening out there. It's like, what steps can families actually take to prevent teen alcohol abuse in the first place? How can we create environments where young people really feel supported and resilient and empowered to just say no to alcohol\uc0\u65311 \

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  That's the million dollar question, isn't it? And while there's no easy answer, I think it starts with fostering open communication, setting clear boundaries around alcohol use, and most importantly, modeling healthy coping mechanisms ourselves. Hopefully, our program will reach more people and let them take action together to create a healthier, safer environment for teens.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0 \
I can't agree more. This episode, I think, both heartbreaking and incredibly helpful at the same time. Li Yang's story is a powerful reminder of how devastating addiction can be, but it also shines a light on the incredible resilience of the human spirit, especially when it's surrounded by love and unwavering support.\

\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\fs24 \cf0 Emily:
\f1\b0  Hey everyone, welcome to today\'92s episode of our podcast. I\'92m Emily, and today we\'92re tackling a heavy yet critical topic\'97teen drug abuse in China and the incredible strength families show in helping their children overcome it. Rocho, it\'92s great to have you co-hosting this episode with me again. I hope our discussion sparks deeper reflection on this urgent issue.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  Absolutely, Emily. This is a huge responsibility. Teen drug abuse is becoming more alarming\'97so many young people, often out of curiosity, end up trapped in addiction. It\'92s heartbreaking. So, what\'92s special about the case we\'92re sharing today?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  Today\'92s story is about Liu Yu, a 17-year-old high school student. He was just like any other teenager\'97leading a normal, happy school life. He had good grades, an outgoing personality, and a close group of friends. But everything changed one night at an off-campus party. Rocho, can you picture the scene? A group of teenagers hanging out, looking for excitement\'97and before they know it, drugs are introduced into the mix, catching them completely off guard.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  That\'92s terrifying. Teens are naturally curious, which makes them vulnerable to peer pressure. How exactly did Liu Yu get involved with drugs? Was he deliberately targeted?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  That night, a so-called "new friend" brought out some candy-like substances, claiming they would make everyone feel energized and relaxed. Yu didn't even realize it was drugs. He tried them out of curiosity, and before long, he found himself craving more. To keep getting these "candies," he started hanging out with the wrong crowd and even secretly took money from his parents. Gradually, his grades plummeted, his once-healthy body became weak, and his mental state deteriorated.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  That\'92s terrible. His parents must have noticed something was wrong, right? How did they find out he was using drugs?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  Liu Yu became unusually sleepy at times, and his mood swings were extreme. Plus, he was spending money in suspicious ways. Then one day, his parents accidentally found leftover drug packaging in his room. That was the moment everything hit them\'97they couldn\'92t believe their once well-behaved son had fallen into drug use.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  I can only imagine how devastating that must have been for them. What did they do next? Did they take him straight to rehab, or did they try talking to him first?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  They didn\'92t panic. They knew that what Liu Yu needed most at that moment was understanding and support, not blame. So, they took time to calm themselves down before sitting him down for an honest conversation. With their patience and encouragement, Liu Yu finally broke down and admitted everything\'97his fears, regrets, and how he had been misled by his so-called friends. He never even realized he was taking drugs at first, and by the time he figured it out, he was already hooked.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  That\'92s incredible. Staying calm in such a situation is unbelievably hard for parents. But of course, just talking wasn\'92t enough\'97they had to take real action to help him quit.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  Exactly. His parents started searching for the best rehab centers and addiction counselors. They accompanied him to consultations, learning everything they could about the withdrawal process. Liu Yu\'92s father even took time off work, while his mother stayed by his side, offering constant care and support. The withdrawal process was brutal\'97Liu Yu experienced severe physical discomfort and emotional breakdowns. At times, he felt like giving up. But his parents never left his side, encouraging him to push through.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  Overcoming addiction is incredibly tough. His parents\'92 unwavering support must have made a huge difference. Were there any particularly difficult moments during his recovery?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  Definitely. One of the biggest challenges was dealing with his old "friends." They kept reaching out, tempting him to relapse. There was even a time when Liu Yu almost gave in\'97he planned to sneak out and meet them. Fortunately, his parents caught on just in time. They calmly explained the dangers and reminded him why he needed to stay clean. To reinforce his recovery, they also reached out to his school, informing teachers about his situation. The school was incredibly supportive, assigning a counselor to help Liu Yu readjust and rebuild his academic life.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  That\'92s so inspiring. It\'92s amazing to see how much his parents and school cared. So, did he manage to fully recover? How is he doing now?\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  After more than a year of hard work, Liu Yu finally broke free from addiction. He returned to school, caught up with his studies, and now appreciates life more than ever. He\'92s even an active participant in anti-drug campaigns, sharing his story to warn other students about the dangers of drug abuse. His relationship with his parents has also grown stronger, and their family life is back on track.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  That\'92s such a powerful story. It really shows the strength of family support. I hope Liu Yu\'92s experience serves as a wake-up call for more families and gives hope to those who are still struggling with addiction.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  Absolutely. Families play an irreplaceable role in a teenager\'92s life. When a child falls into something as dangerous as drug addiction, the love, patience, and unwavering support of their parents can be the key to helping them escape the darkness. Through Liu Yu\'92s story, we want to raise awareness about the severity of teen drug abuse and remind young people that drugs only lead to destruction\'97but the love of their family will always be their strongest shield.\

\f0\b Rocho:
\f1\b0  Well said. I truly hope more people hear this episode. Let\'92s work together to keep drugs away from our youth and create a safe, healthy environment for them to grow.\

\f0\b Emily:
\f1\b0  That\'92s it for this episode of *Health Voices*. If you found this story inspiring, don\'92t forget to like, share, and follow our channel. Thank you all for tuning in! We\'92ll see you in the next episode.\
